            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This website is to portray my travel experience to Virgina and Maryland. Virginia is home to some of the top tourist attractions and landmarks in the United States, offering plenty of things to see and do for all interests.
               Among these Luray Caverns and Virginia Safari Park are the places one must visit in East Coast of America.
                The world-famous Baltimore's National Aquarium which sees over 1.6 visitors per year. I have visited this place three times so far and always feel like visiting this place as many time as I can. I hope you will like it too!</p>
